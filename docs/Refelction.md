# Reflection

This was more of a learning experience. This was the final project of the ID tech camp, and the qualified instructors really helped me out on this one.

I looked at other's solution to other's problems and employed my own. I read an article (aqibsaeed.github.io/2016-09-03-urban-sound-classification-part-1/) that was extremely helpful.

I'll hopefully learn how reccurent neural networks work in general in the near future. RNN are designed for stuff like audio, video, etc.
